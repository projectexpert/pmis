Risk Management
===============

Originally developed by Tactix4 Ltd (version 7, http://www.tactix4.com) and Neova Health (version 8,
http://www.neovahealth.co.uk). This version is integrated with project_charter module by Matmoz d.o.o.
(version 8, http://www.matmoz.si).

This module allows to manage risk in at least two different contexts:

* Project Management

* Business Continuity Planning

A risk is always associated with a project and has an impact and probability assessment pre- and post-response
with resulting expected values (scores). Actions on risk are tasks, which can be identified easily in the
extended task view (Projects > Tasks) via the 'Action on Risk' filter and associated risk id. In addition,
tasks which are actions on risks are coloured green in the task list (tree) view.

Risk categories, response categories and proximity are set-up according to the PRINCE2 project methodology as
well as for Business Continuity Planning. They are easily changed via the 'Configuration' menu to get them in
accordance with PIP, SCRUM or DSDM.

Besides the above mentioned information the following information can and ought to be documented as well:
Risk description, author, date registered, date modified, event, effect, cause and risk owner.

Installation
============

* The module automatically takes care of its dependencies and is ready for use after the installation
