Project progress measurement
============================

The progress of a project indicates the degree of completion, with respect
to the estimated scope of work. Generally the progress cannot be
automatically measured and it is based on the expert judgement or the
completion of checklists that determine the degree of completion of a
project.

Define Project Progress Measurements:
-------------------------------------

Project Progress Measurements record the results of the measurement on
a project. A Progress Measurement is defined by the following attributes:

* Project
* Date: When the measurement occurred
* Progress Type
* Value: Results of the measurement. Must be defined in the precision indicated by the progress type. The user cannot enter a value that exceeds the maximum permitted value for that progress type.
* Description: description of the measurement
* Entered by: User that entered the measurement
