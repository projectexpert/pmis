Work In Progress Statement
==========================

The Revenue Principle of GAAP requires Revenue to be recorded in the period
it is Earned regardless of when it is billed or when cash is received.

In some cases, it is simple to determine the timing for Revenues Earned, once
ownership of a product is transferred or a service is complete, revenue is
considered to have been earned.

But if revenue recognition were delayed until the end of a long term contract,
the Matching Principle of tying revenues and their direct costs to each other
would be violated. The solution to this problem is the Percentage of
Completion method of Revenue Recognition.

Contract Revenues are tied to Costs, but Billings on Contracts are not always
tied to Costs. Sometimes elements of a contract are billed in advance or
sometimes they are delayed by mutual agreement (or disagreement).

This mismatch between actual billed revenue and earned revenue will require an
adjusting entry but since the Percentage of Completion method adjusts billed
revenue to reflect earned revenue, billings are posted to revenues and
adjusted later to reflect the correct earned revenue amount.
(Debit Accounts Receivable, Credit Sales).

Long Term Contracts will have estimates for both sides of a contract,
Costs and Revenues. Calculating Percentage of Completion requires both total
actual and total estimated numbers to calculate a percentage so it uses the
side where both the actual and estimated numbers can be known, Costs.

Percent Complete = Actual Costs to Date / Total Estimated Costs
The Percent Complete is then applied to the Total Estimated Revenue to
determine Earned Revenue to Date.

Earned Revenue to Date = Percent Complete * Total Estimated Revenue
Finally, the Earned Revenue to Date is compared to the Billings on Contract
to Date. The difference is either added to or subtracted from the Revenue.

Total Billings on Contract - Earned Revenue to Date = Over/Under Billed Revenue

The Over/Under Billed Revenue accounts are Balance Sheet Accounts and they
are often called either Billings in Excess of Costs (liability account that
reflects over-billings) or Costs in Excess of Billings (asset account that
reflects under-billings).

Work in Progress Statement
--------------------------
The Work In Progress Statement is associated to the Percentage of Completion
Method, and is used to compile the information necessary for the percentage
of completion calculations, but also to provide crucial information about the
total value and progress of work on hand inventory.

The statement provides the following information:

* Contract/Project name.
* Contract/Project code.
* Contract/Project Value. As the Total Estimated Revenue of the contract.
* Actual Billings to Date. Total invoiced amount issued to the customer to date.
* Actual Costs to Date.
* Total Estimated Costs.
* Estimated Costs to Complete. Total Estimated Costs – Actual Costs to Date.
* Estimated Gross Profit. Contract Value – Total Estimated Costs.
* Percent Complete. Actual Costs to Date / Total Estimated Costs.
* Earned Revenue to Date. Percent Complete * Total Estimated Revenue
* Over Billings. Total Billings on Contract – Earned Revenue to Date (when > 0 )
* Under Billings. Total Billings on Contract – Earned Revenue to Date (when < 0 )
