===================
Preview attachments
===================

Legacy version of the OCA's attachment_preview module to avoid problems and
glitches after the implementation of the new viewerjs version.

This addon allows to preview attachments supported by http://viewerjs.org.

Currently, that's most Libreoffice files and PDFs.

Installation
============

For filetype recognition, you'll get the best results by installing
``python-magic``::

sudo apt-get install python-magic

Usage
=====

The module adds a little print preview icon right of download links for
attachments or binary fields.
