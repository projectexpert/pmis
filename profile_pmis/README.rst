Project Information System
==========================

Customizes the PM UI to follow the pmbok and iso 21500. Installs the dependencies
needed for project planning, resource planning, billing plan, stakeholders management,
risk management, integrates the crm features with project management and aims to make
the project form as the center form to manage all the activities for a project oriented
company organization.

The project form is redesigned in a two-level notebook (to simulate sub menus) to keep
the main project view less cluttered. It also aims to keep the insertion order oriented
towards the productivity following the most usual Project Management Initiation and
Planning workflow as per PMBOK and ISO 21500.
