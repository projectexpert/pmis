          <p class="oe_mt32"> A work breakdown structure (WBS), in project
            management and systems engineering, is a deliverable oriented
            decomposition of a project into smaller components. </p>
          <p class="oe_mt32"> A work breakdown structure element may be a
            product, data, service, or any combination thereof. A WBS also
            provides the necessary framework for detailed cost estimating and
            control along with providing guidance for schedule development and
            control. </p>

        <div class="oe_span6">
          <p class="oe_mt32"> Once you start creating a project, you should be
            decomposing it into smaller, more manageable components, that you
            can classify as project, phase, deliverable or work package. The
            hierarchy of the project is considered the Work Breakdown Structure
            and the individual projects are considered WBS components. </p>
          <p class="oe_mt32"> When you define a new project you should enter the
            name of the WBS component and the code. Then you should indicate the
            parent WBS component in the tab "Other info". The complete WBS name
            of the path and complete WBS code of the path to that component will
            be calculated and shown. </p>
          <p class="oe_mt32"> You have full visibility of the whole WBS
            hierarchy at all times in the Kanban, Tree and Form views. </p>
          <p class="oe_mt32"> You can quickly display the whole WBS hierarchy if
            you search by "Complete WBS Code" or "Complete WBS Name" and
            indicate the parent WBS Component code or name. </p>
          <p class="oe_mt32"> In the Form view a tab "WBS Components" will
            display the inmediate lower level components of the current project.
