Analytic Resource Planning
==========================

An effective planning of the resources required for a project or analytic
account becomes essential in organizations that are run by projects, or
profit center accounting. The process of resource planning generally follows
an rolling wave planning approach, in which the level of detail of the
planned resources increases over time, as the details of the work required
are known to the planning group.

Resources planned for a project/analytic account have an impact on the planned
costs. If the resources are procured internally, the standard cost is
determined. If the resources are procured externally, the user can indicate
the supplier, and the planned costs are then determined on the basis of the
supplier's price list.

Multiple planning versions can be maintained for a resource plan, so that
the organization can create a first rough-cut resource plan, that can then
be refined as the project progresses.
