"PROJECT OBJECTIVES\n"
"The success of your project will be defined by how well you\n"
"meet your objectives. The more explicitly you state your\n"
"objectives at the outset, the less disagreement there will\n"
"be at the end about whether you have met them. Remember\n"
"that at this early stage of the project, there are still\n"
"many “unknown factors”. Be prepared to revise your\n"
"objectives as you gather more information about what you\n"
"need to achieve.\n"
"\n"
"WRITING PROJECT OBJECTIVES\n"
"Project objectives are concrete statements that describe\n"
"what the project is trying to achieve. Objectives should\n"
"be developed for time, cost, quality (or functionality)\n"
"and should:\n"
"\n"
"* Be aligned to business objectives\n"
"* Be measurable\n"
"* Be achievable\n"
"* Be consistent\n"
"* Be readily understandable\n"
"* Be few in number\n"
"* Have the full support and commitment of key stakeholders\n"
