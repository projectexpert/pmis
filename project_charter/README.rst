===============
Project Charter
===============

Customizes the PM UI to follow the pmbok and iso 21500
document Project Charter, with all it's contents:

* project charter
* project description (with ckeditor4)
* project scope
* project success
* project requirements integrated with change management
  (when the change management module is installed)
* project stakeholders
* resource and billing plan
* risk assesment integrated with risk management

The project form is redesigned in a two-level notebook (to simulate sub menus) to keep
the main project view less cluttered. It also aims to keep the insertion order oriented
towards the productivity following the most usual Project Management Initiation and
Planning workflow as per PMBOK and ISO 21500.

Installation
============

* The module automatically takes care of its dependencies and is ready for use after the installation
